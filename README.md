This repository demonstrates a common React bug: an infinite loop caused by incorrectly updating state within a useEffect hook's dependency array.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises when the state variable `count` is updated within the useEffect function without proper dependency management, leading to continuous re-renders and an infinite loop.
